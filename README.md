# Hangman
Hangman in C
By Kian Bacon

## Inspiration
I was looking for a challenge that I could code entirely in C, but that would resemble something that would typically be made in an object oriented programming language. 

## What it does
This project recreates the classic game Hangman. It allows a user to select from predetermined categories and try to guess the word that is generated before they run out of chances.

## How I built it
This project is made entirely in C. 

## Challenges we ran into
There were a lot of small nuances that would have been easily fixable in a more common language, but that were challenging to fix in C. A lot of the work had to be done from scratch and required creative thinking to figure out how to accomplish my goals and additional features. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Despite all the complications in implementing them, I was able to add small features that drastically improved the game experience, such as being able to display the previously guessed incorrect letters. I'm very proud of being able to produce this entirely in C and not relying on a more complex language to do so. 

## What I learned
I truly challenged myself to add features that I could have done without, but that I felt would improve the user experience. I learned more about the different implementations in C and the interaction between specific pre-set functions and user input, especially with the nuances of scanf();

## What's next for Hangman
I plan on improving this in the future with new features, especially a retry button, and possibly redoing this project on a larger scale with an object oriented programming language.
